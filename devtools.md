### DevTools and Debugging


#### DevTools

- **Redux DevTools Extension**

#### DevTools Monitors

- **Log Monitor**

- **Dock Monitor**

  A resizable and movable container for other monitors.

- **Inspector Monitor**  
  https://github.com/alexkuz/redux-devtools-inspector  
  A state monitor that provides a convenient way to inspect "real world" app states that could be complicated and deeply nested, by pinning keys of interest and showing state diffs.
  
- **Diff Monitor**  
  https://github.com/whetstone/redux-devtools-diff-monitor  
  The primary goal of this monitor is to highlight the changes to an application's state from action to action.
