### Immutable Data


#### Immutable Data Structures

- **Immutable.js**  
  https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/  
  Fully-featured data structures library that uses advanced internal data storage to efficiently manage modified references.  Very widely used, but also rather complex.
  
- **seamless-immutable**  
  https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable  
  Immutable data structures for JavaScript which are backwards-compatible with normal JS Arrays and Objects.  Uses freezing.
  
- **redux-tcomb**  
  https://github.com/gcanti/redux-tcomb  
  Immutable and type-checked state and actions for Redux (built on tcomb library)

#### Immutable Update Utilities


- **immutable-ops**  
  https://github.com/tommikaikkonen/immutable-ops  
A collection of functions to perform immutable operations on plain JavaScript objects and arrays.  Like updeep but with batched mutations and no freezing.  Like icepick, but with batched mutations and a curried API that puts the target object as the last argument. No freezing.

- **Redecorate**  
  https://github.com/Wildhoney/Redecorate  
  Simple module for reducing immutable nested properties in Redux applications.  



#### Immutable.js-Redux Interop

- **redux-immutable**  
  https://github.com/gajus/redux-immutable  
  redux-immutable is used to create an equivalent function of Redux combineReducers that works with Immutable.js state.

- **immutable-redux**  
  https://github.com/unindented/immutable-redux  
  Provides utilities for dealing with Immutable data structures in Redux.



#### Alternate Data Management Concepts

- **redux-orm**  
  https://github.com/tommikaikkonen/redux-orm  
  A small, simple and immutable ORM to manage relational data in your Redux store. Provides a Model-like interface on top of a portion of your store, allowing you to define relations between Models, store values as "tables" in your state, and make immutable updates by assigning values to Model fields.

- **reduxdb**  
  https://github.com/wizawu/reduxdb  
  Redux with MongoDB-like API.  Dispatches internal Redux actions in response to API calls like `db.someCollection.insert({id : 1, name "abc"})`.
