### Component/Local State

- **redux-ui**  
  https://github.com/tonyhb/redux-ui  
  Easy UI state management for react redux.  Think of redux-ui as block-level scoping for UI state.

- **redux-react-local**  
  https://github.com/threepointone/redux-react-local  
  Creates component wrappers with per-instance local state stored in Redux, as well as locally scoped actions and reducers

- **Redux-Staged-State**  
  https://github.com/mboperator/redux-modules  
  The goal of this library is to provide a convenient way to manage transient state in a redux application.  The idea is similar to that of redux-form, but it differs in that it does not focus on forms, but on staged state, that is, parts of the state the a user intends to change but has not committed yet. Staged state may appear in different forms.
