### Alternate Approaches and Variations

- **redux-controller**  
  https://github.com/lexich/redux-controller  
  redux-controller helps to generate controllers (functions) with access to (dispatch and getState) redux functionality without binding to React components.
  
- **react-redux-controller**  
  https://github.com/artsy/react-redux-controller  
  https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/3z13qs/new_library_reactreduxcontroller/  
  Library for creating a controller layer to link React and Redux, on top of react-redux.
  
- **Redacs**  
  https://github.com/daniel-lundin/redacs  
  Experimental redux-like state management with actions and reducers combined into reducer actions
  
- **redux-store**  
  https://github.com/bingomanatee/redux-store  
  A store/action subsystem for redux.  
  
- **react-redux-connect-context**  
  https://github.com/qwtel/react-redux-connect-context  
  Enhanced version of redux' connect that puts action creators in the child context
  
- **redux-viewmodel**  
  https://github.com/tdzl2003/redux-viewmodel  
  React-ViewModel make it possible to write 'ViewModel' classes to reorganize code for reducer implement in Redux.
  
- **Replux**  
  https://github.com/gregthebusker/replux  
  Self contained components and enhancements for Redux
  
- **Reductor**  
  https://github.com/mbensch/reductor  
  Opinionated JS framework for React/Redux based applications.
  
- **Redux Model Utilities**  
  https://github.com/jbellsey/redux-model-utils  
  A set of model-building utilities for Redux apps.  Atomic actions and reducers, easy connection to React components, direct read-only access to the model state, subscription change notifications.
  
- **Vada**  
  https://github.com/xogeny/vada  
  https://medium.com/@mtiller/encapsulating-application-logic-with-reactors-392635763e7  
  Code to support a viewless, action driven architecture
  
- **redux-apis**  
  https://github.com/Download/redux-apis  
  Create class-based APIs that hide the fact that Redux is being used.
  
- **react-redux-provide**  
  https://github.com/loggur/react-redux-provide  
  https://medium.com/@timbur/react-automatic-redux-providers-and-replicators-c4e35a39f1  
  Wrap components with a smart component and later assign providers (i.e., stores and action creators) to it.
  
- **redux-tree**  
  https://github.com/dashed/redux-tree  
  Organize your redux stores in a tree-like structure.  redux-trees are tree-like structured schemas where the leaves are either another redux-tree or a redux compatible reducer (not both).
  
- **modular-redux**  
  https://github.com/ariporad/modular-redux  
  Build completely modular applications with redux
  
- **redux-2way-binding**  
  https://github.com/roderickwang/redux-2way-binding  
  Build two way binding with Redux and Immutable.
  
- **redux-interactions**  
  https://github.com/convoyinc/redux-interactions  
  A streamlined approach to managing your Redux action creators and reducers.  These observations have landed us on a pattern where you group related action creators and reducers into a single file, which we call an interaction.
  
- **redux-simple**  
  https://github.com/barbuza/redux-simple  
  Batching react-redux alternative with reverse subscription order.  Exposes Provider and connect with api similar to react-redux
  
- **Gambit**  
  https://github.com/Ghirro/gambit  
  Gambit is a hyper-thin library designed to make building API driven apps with Redux/React easier. It is not a Redux replacement, it is a library built on top of Redux.
  
- **remerge**  
  https://github.com/siawyoung/remerge  
  The sole purpose of Remerge is to provide a consistent interface for defining and manipulating state. It's extremely easy and intuitive to use once you get the hang of it. While there is a slight learning curve, hopefully our examples will ease the learning process.  Although Remerge was built for use with Redux, it can also be used standalone.

- **two-way-rest**  
  https://github.com/l2silver/two-way-rest  
  A react-redux plugin that facilitates changes to the state and backend data sources.

- **Radical**  
  https://github.com/nathan-rice/radical  
  Radical is a client API framework, designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of React/Redux applications. Radical allows you to model your client API and state via the composition of Actions and Namespaces.

- **redux-nimble**  
  https://github.com/bodyflex/redux-nimble  
  A library that removes a lot of the boilerplate necessary to use redux.

- **redux-direct**  
  https://github.com/LiquidLabsGmbH/redux-direct  
  With redux-direct you can use your action creators directly inside the reducers instead of having to define string constants for each action.
  
- **Tango**  
  https://github.com/Graf009/tango  
  Toolkit for building redux/react applications.  Easy to understand objects instead of crazy functional composition. Bundle groups of middleware, enhancers, and reducers together as "plugins". Dead simple Component API - use ES6 classes, bring back sane behavior, bind component functions scope to class (like old react), never write mapDispatchToProps or mapStateToProps.
