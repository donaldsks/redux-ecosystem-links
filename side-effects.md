### Side Effects


- **redux-thunk**  
  https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk  
  The simplest possible side effects approach: dispatch functions instead of objects, which then get access to `dispatch` and `getState`
  
- **redux-saga**  
  https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga  
  Generator-based side effects approach.  Create "sagas", which act like background threads or daemons that can listen for actions and dispatch objects describing side effects.
  
- **react-redux-saga**  
  https://github.com/threepointone/react-redux-saga  
  React bindings for redux-saga, allowing you to dynamically start sagas by mounting them as React components
  
- **redux-loop**  
  https://github.com/raisemarketplace/redux-loop  
  Sequence your effects naturally and purely by returning them from your reducers.  Also returns descriptive objects, which are executed later.
  
- **redux-side-effects**  
  https://github.com/salsita/redux-side-effects  
  Redux toolset for keeping all the side effects inside your reducers while maintaining their purity, using generators.
  
- **redux-task**  
  https://github.com/sskyy/redux-task  
  A Side Effects enhancer for redux. The idea is simple: By given an asynchronous task(such as submitting data to server) a name, redux-task will create and handle the task state for you automatically. Then you can retrieve the state with the task name in your component easily. No need to create store state like isSubmitting or submitFailed and manully change them any more. 
  
- **redux-saga-rxjs**  
  https://github.com/salsita/redux-saga-rxjs  
  RxJS implementation of the Saga pattern for Redux.
