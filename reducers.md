  A utility to wrap many copies of a single Redux reducer into a single key-based reducer.

- **redux-modules**
  https://github.com/mboperator/redux-modules  
  A library for defining clear, boilerplate free Redux reducers with typechecked action payloads. Based on the redux duck paradigm proposed by erikras.
  
- **redux-operations**  
  https://github.com/mattkrick/redux-operations

  https://medium.com/@matt.krick/introducing-redux-operations-332ab56e468b    
  Adds additional logic to reducers to handle ordering of reducer handling, dynamic state creation, and display of reducer behavior in the Redux DevTools.
  
- **redux-components**  
  https://github.com/wcjohnson/redux-components  
  A component model for Redux state trees based on the React.js component model and other familiar design patterns from the React ecosystem.  Allows creation of "reducer components" that can be dynamically added and removed, and targeted with scoped actions.
  
- **redux-reducer-factory**  
  https://github.com/mclauia/redux-reducer-factory  
  A configurable createReducer factory (i.e. it is a factory for making a createReducer function) that essentially allows projects to insert extra generic reducers (enhancers) before and after individual domain reducers are invoked, without muddying those individual domains.
  
- **redux-undo**  
  https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo  
  Higher order reducer to add undo/redo functionality to redux state containers
  
- **redux-ignore**  
  https://github.com/omnidan/redux-ignore  
  Higher-order reducer to ignore redux actions
  
- **redux-recycle**  
  https://github.com/omnidan/redux-recycle  
  Higher-order reducer to reset the redux state on certain actions
  
- **redux-optimist**  
  https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/redux-optimist  
  Optimistically apply actions that can be later commited or reverted.
